# **Unveiling Trends in Video Games: Interactive Exploration with Streamlit**

## **Introduction**

The video game industry has come a long way since its early days, evolving into one of the most dynamic and innovative entertainment sectors. Every year, thousands of games are released across a wide variety of platforms and genres, each competing for the attention of players worldwide. But have you ever wondered which genres dominate the charts or how platform trends have shifted over time?

These are not just casual questionsâ€”they reflect broader patterns in consumer preferences, technological advancements, and industry strategies. However, finding answers can be tricky without the right tools. Thatâ€™s where data analysis comes in.

For this project, I worked with a dataset of video games to uncover insights about trends in genres, platforms, and ratings. But instead of burying these findings in static graphs or lengthy code snippets, I took it a step further and built an **interactive Streamlit app**. Whether youâ€™re a gaming enthusiast, developer, or data explorer, this app lets you dive into the dataset and uncover your own insights, no coding required!

## **About the Dataset**

Before we get into the insights, letâ€™s take a quick look at the dataset. This curated collection of video game data contains information about thousands of games across various genres, platforms, and years. Here are some key variables included in the dataset:

| **Variable**       | **Description**                                      | **Type**       |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| `name`             | Title of the video game                              | String         |
| `rating`           | Average user rating for the game                     | Float          |
| `platforms`        | Platforms the game is available on (e.g., PC, Xbox)  | String         |
| `genres`           | Genres the game belongs to (e.g., Action, RPG)       | String         |
| `release_date`     | Date the game was released                           | Date           |
| `year`             | Year extracted from the release date                | Integer        |

This dataset gives us a unique opportunity to analyze not just the games themselves but also broader trends across the gaming industry. For those interested in exploring the raw data, the cleaned dataset is available in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/LucasW-BYU/Post-2-Video-Rating.git)) under the name `igdb_games_clean_data_sorted.csv`.

## **Motivating Questions**

The gaming industry is vast, but this project focuses on answering two key questions:
1. **Which genres are home to the top-rated games?**  
2. **How has platform popularity evolved over time?**

By tackling these questions, we can gain a better understanding of what makes certain games or platforms successful. These insights can be useful for developers, publishers, and even players curious about industry trends.

## **Key Insights**

### **1. Which Genres Dominate Top-Rated Games?**

Genres play a significant role in shaping a game's appeal. Some genres thrive because they offer action-packed gameplay, while others captivate audiences with immersive storytelling. Using this dataset, I explored the genres that consistently receive the highest ratings.

Hereâ€™s a sneak peek: **Action** and **RPG** games dominate the charts. Below is a bar chart showcasing the top 10 highest-rated games in the **Action** genre.

#### **What This Tells Us**
- Titles like *Lizards Must Die* and *Grand Theft Auto V* consistently rank highly, demonstrating the universal appeal of action games.
- RPGs like *The Witcher 3* stand out for their immersive storytelling and character-driven gameplay.

This analysis highlights how certain genres cater to specific player preferences, whether itâ€™s the adrenaline of action games or the depth of RPGs.

### **2. Platform Popularity Over the Years**

Platforms are the gateway to gaming. From the golden days of Nintendo and PlayStation to the rise of PC gaming, platforms have played a crucial role in defining how games are experienced. Using the dataset, I analyzed platform trends over time.

The line chart below shows how platform popularity has shifted between 2000 and 2020.

- **PC gaming** has seen steady growth, bolstered by platforms like Steam and advancements in hardware.
- **PlayStation and Xbox platforms** remain consistent favorites, showcasing their strong foothold in the gaming industry.

These trends provide valuable insights into how technology, accessibility, and consumer preferences drive changes in the industry.
