# Welcome to My First Blog Post!

This is my first post on this blog, and I am very excited!

## My First Career Fair Experience at BYU: Lessons Learned and Tips for Success

I recently attended the career fair held by Brigham Young University (BYU), and it was a fulfilling experience. In this blog post, I’ll share my journey and the emotions I experienced throughout the event. Attending a career fair can be overwhelming, especially if your portfolio lacks standout projects or noteworthy internships. Sometimes, I felt insecure, wondering what to say to companies and whether I had enough to offer. But I’ve come to realize these feelings are natural and shouldn't hold you back from seizing opportunities.

## Confidence is Key

One of the most important things I learned is that you’re often more competent than you give yourself credit for. Regardless of your résumé, confidence is what matters most in conversations with potential employers. Each connection, whether successful or a learning experience, is valuable.

For example, my résumé doesn't feature extraordinary projects or impressive internships. It’s modest, but I was fortunate to get interview invites from several companies. At first, I thought it was just luck, but I soon realized that my confidence and willingness to step outside my comfort zone played a huge role. Whether your CV is impressive or not, how you present yourself—with confidence—can make all the difference. Companies are more likely to see your potential if you show that you believe in yourself.

## Practical Tips for Career Fair Success

Based on my experience, here are a few practical tips that I found helpful at the career fair:

### 1. Dress Professionally
Showing up in business attire tells recruiters you take the event seriously, and it can increase your chances of landing an interview. Your appearance is often the first impression you make, so present yourself well.

### 2. Do Your Research
Knowing which companies are attending and which ones are hiring for roles related to your major is essential. I prepared multiple copies of my résumé, customizing each one to match the specific companies I was interested in. Doing your research beforehand helps you have more meaningful conversations with recruiters and increases your chances of standing out.

### 3. Have Meaningful Conversations
Instead of just handing over your résumé and leaving, take the time to engage with recruiters. Knowing something about the companies you're interested in will help you have deeper conversations and show your genuine interest. I made a point to visit as many booths as I could and collect as much information as possible. Building connections is key.

## The Power of Networking

Attending a career fair isn’t just about handing out résumés; it's about building relationships that can help you in your future job search. Even if you don't leave with an interview, the experience is incredibly valuable. It allows you to practice your networking skills, learn about different companies, and gain confidence in speaking with professionals. You never know which conversation could lead to an internship or job offer down the line.
