## Welcome to My first Blog!!!!!!
This is my first post on this blog, and I am very excited!
## Career Fair Experience 
It is my first time attending career fair, it is really fun. I got to talk to a lot of different companies Hr managers, and I learned a lot of things about different companies. I think the career fair is really useful, because it definitly helped me to see what I am lacking of.
