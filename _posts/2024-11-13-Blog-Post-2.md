#    **Introduction**

<div style="font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.5; color: #333;">
Have you ever wondered what makes certain video games more successful than others? 🎲 As a passionate gamer, I wanted to uncover the factors that influence a game's rating. Could it be the platform, the genre, the developer, or maybe the timing of the release? To answer these questions, I turned to data science and the <strong>Internet Game Database (IGDB) API</strong> to collect and analyze video game data.

In this tutorial, I’ll guide you through the process of collecting video game data from the IGDB API, cleaning it, and performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and insights. Whether you're a fellow gamer or a data science student, this guide will provide you with the tools to do your analysis on video games or similar data using Python and APIs.

# **1. What is IGDB?**

The **Internet Game Database (IGDB)** provides a vast collection of game information, including genres, platforms, release dates, and ratings. In this project, I focused on attributes like **ratings**, **genre**, **platform**, and **release date** to explore patterns that might contribute to a game’s success.


#  **2. Data Collection and Ethics**

To gather data for this analysis, I used the [IGDB API](https://api-docs.igdb.com/), a database with extensive game information. I ensured ethical practices by adhering to rate limits and using secure API key management.

Using Python and the `requests` library, I collected game data, including genre, platform, rating, company, and release date. After some cleaning, I had a dataset with over **10,000 games**.

# **3. Authenticating the IGDB API**

To access the IGDB API, you’ll need to authenticate using an OAuth 2.0 token provided by Twitch. The authentication process requires your Client ID and Client Secret from the IGDB API. Here’s how to set up the authentication in Python.

1. Set up the Authentication URL: The authentication URL is used to request an access token from Twitch.

2. Define Parameters: We use a dictionary to specify the client_id, client_secret, and grant_type (set to 'client_credentials') required for authentication.

3. Make the Authentication Request: Use Python’s requests.post() to send the authentication request, passing in the parameters.

4. Extract the Access Token: Once authenticated, we receive an access token in the JSON response. This token is needed to access IGDB’s API endpoints.

# ** 5.EDA**
With the dataset cleaned and prepared, the next step was to dive into some exploratory data analysis (EDA) to get a sense of trends and relationships within the data. By visualizing ratings across different game genres, platforms, and over time, we can start identifying patterns that may influence a game's success. Here are three key insights derived from the EDA:

# Average Rating by Genre
The first visualization displays the average rating across various game genres. Tactical, Real-Time Strategy (RTS), and Music games top the list with some of the highest average ratings. This suggests that players may value strategic depth or immersive music experiences in these genres, leading to higher ratings. On the other hand, genres like Quiz/Trivia tend to have lower ratings, which could indicate limited replayability or niche appeal. Further investigation into each genre’s unique characteristics could shed light on why certain genres consistently receive higher ratings.
