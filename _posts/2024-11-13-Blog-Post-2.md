<div style="font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.5; color: #333;">
Have you ever wondered what makes certain video games more successful than others? ðŸŽ² As a passionate gamer, I wanted to uncover the factors that influence a game's rating. Could it be the platform, the genre, the developer, or maybe the timing of the release? To answer these questions, I turned to data science and the <strong>Internet Game Database (IGDB) API</strong> to collect and analyze video game data.

In this tutorial, Iâ€™ll guide you through the process of collecting video game data from the IGDB API, cleaning it, and performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and insights. Whether you're a fellow gamer or a data science student, this guide will provide you with the tools to do your analysis on video games or similar data using Python and APIs.

# 1. Data Collection and Ethics

To gather data for this analysis, I used the [IGDB API](https://api-docs.igdb.com/), a database with extensive game information. I ensured ethical practices by adhering to rate limits and using secure API key management.

Using Python and the `requests` library, I collected game data, including genre, platform, rating, company, and release date. After some cleaning, I had a dataset with over **10,000 games**.
