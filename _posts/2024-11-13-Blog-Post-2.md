#    **Introduction**

<div style="font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.5; color: #333;">
Have you ever wondered what makes certain video games more successful than others? ðŸŽ² As a passionate gamer, I wanted to uncover the factors that influence a game's rating. Could it be the platform, the genre, the developer, or maybe the timing of the release? To answer these questions, I turned to data science and the <strong>Internet Game Database (IGDB) API</strong> to collect and analyze video game data.

In this tutorial, Iâ€™ll guide you through the process of collecting video game data from the IGDB API, cleaning it, and performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and insights. Whether you're a fellow gamer or a data science student, this guide will provide you with the tools to do your analysis on video games or similar data using Python and APIs.

# **1. What is IGDB?**

The **Internet Game Database (IGDB)** provides a vast collection of game information, including genres, platforms, release dates, and ratings. In this project, I focused on attributes like **ratings**, **genre**, **platform**, and **release date** to explore patterns that might contribute to a gameâ€™s success.


#  **2. Data Collection and Ethics**

To gather data for this analysis, I used the [IGDB API](https://api-docs.igdb.com/), a database with extensive game information. I ensured ethical practices by adhering to rate limits and using secure API key management.

Using Python and the `requests` library, I collected game data, including genre, platform, rating, company, and release date. After some cleaning, I had a dataset with over **10,000 games**.

# **3. Authenticating the IGDB API**

To access the IGDB API, youâ€™ll need to authenticate using an OAuth 2.0 token provided by Twitch. The authentication process requires your Client ID and Client Secret from the IGDB API. Hereâ€™s how to set up the authentication in Python.

1. Set up the Authentication URL: The authentication URL is used to request an access token from Twitch.

2. Define Parameters: We use a dictionary to specify the client_id, client_secret, and grant_type (set to 'client_credentials') required for authentication.

3. Make the Authentication Request: Use Pythonâ€™s requests.post() to send the authentication request, passing in the parameters.

4. Extract the Access Token: Once authenticated, we receive an access token in the JSON response. This token is needed to access IGDBâ€™s API endpoints.

# ** 5.EDA**
With the dataset cleaned and prepared, the next step was to dive into some exploratory data analysis (EDA) to get a sense of trends and relationships within the data. By visualizing ratings across different game genres, platforms, and over time, we can start identifying patterns that may influence a game's success. Here are three key insights derived from the EDA:

## Average Rating by Genre
Let's dive into the genres! When we look at the average ratings across different types of games, some interesting patterns emerge. Tactical, Real-Time Strategy (RTS), and Music games are right at the top, boasting the highest average ratings. This could mean that players really appreciate the strategic complexity or immersive qualities these genres bring to the table. Maybe it's the thrill of outsmarting an opponent in a strategy game or getting lost in a beautifully composed soundtrack that earns these games their high praise.

On the other hand, genres like Quiz/Trivia arenâ€™t faring quite as well in the ratings department. It might be that these games have a more limited audience or offer less replay value, which could affect their overall scores. Itâ€™s definitely worth exploring what makes certain genres consistently more popularâ€”could it be the gameplay depth, the emotional impact, or something else entirely?


## Average Rating by Platform (Top 10)

In this chart, I focused on showcasing the top 10 platforms with the highest average game ratings. First, I filtered the data to include only platforms with a substantial number of games, ensuring that the results reflect meaningful averages rather than one-off high ratings. Then, I calculated the average rating for each platform and sorted them in descending order to highlight the best-rated platforms.

The results reveal an interesting mix of classic and modern platforms. Sega Saturn, DOS, and Game Boy Advance top the list, suggesting that games on these platforms resonate well with players, possibly due to nostalgic value or unique gameplay styles from their respective eras. Platforms like Arcade and PlayStation also rank highly, showcasing the timeless appeal of classic games and consoles.
