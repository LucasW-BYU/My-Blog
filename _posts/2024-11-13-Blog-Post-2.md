#    **Introduction**


Have you ever wondered what makes certain video games more successful than others? ðŸŽ² As a passionate gamer, I wanted to uncover the factors that influence a game's rating. Could it be the platform, the genre, the developer, or maybe the timing of the release? To answer these questions, I turned to data science and the <strong>Internet Game Database (IGDB) API</strong> to collect and analyze video game data.

In this tutorial, Iâ€™ll guide you through the process of collecting video game data from the IGDB API, cleaning it, and performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and insights. Whether you're a fellow gamer or a data science student, this guide will provide you with the tools to do your analysis on video games or similar data using Python and APIs.


# **1. What is IGDB?**

The **Internet Game Database (IGDB)** provides a vast collection of game information, including genres, platforms, release dates, and ratings. In this project, I focused on attributes like **ratings**, **genre**, **platform**, and **release date** to explore patterns that might contribute to a gameâ€™s success.


#  **2. Data Collection and Ethics**

To gather data for this analysis, I used the [IGDB API](https://api-docs.igdb.com/), a database with extensive game information. I ensured ethical practices by adhering to rate limits and using secure API key management.

Using Python and the `requests` library, I collected game data, including genre, platform, rating, company, and release date. After some cleaning, I had a dataset with over **10,000 games**.

# **3. Authenticating the IGDB API**

To access the IGDB API, youâ€™ll need to authenticate using an OAuth 2.0 token provided by Twitch. The authentication process requires your Client ID and Client Secret from the IGDB API. Hereâ€™s how to set up the authentication in Python.

1. Set up the Authentication URL: The authentication URL is used to request an access token from Twitch.

2. Define Parameters: We use a dictionary to specify the client_id, client_secret, and grant_type (set to 'client_credentials') required for authentication.

3. Make the Authentication Request: Use Pythonâ€™s requests.post() to send the authentication request, passing in the parameters.

4. Extract the Access Token: Once authenticated, we receive an access token in the JSON response. This token is needed to access IGDBâ€™s API endpoints.

# **4.Build Data Frame**
Once I connected to the IGDB API, I needed to clean up the game data so it would be easy to analyze. Hereâ€™s how I tackled it:

1.Gathering Data in Batches: I set up a loop to pull in batches of games and filtered out entries missing key details like ratings, genres, or platforms.

2. Organizing the Details: For each game, I pulled relevant detailsâ€”like the genre, platform, and company namesâ€”and turned them into neat lists. Release dates came in as timestamps, so I converted those into readable dates.

3. Building a DataFrame: With all this organized, I converted the data into a pandas DataFrame and saved it as a CSV file. This makes it ready for any analysis or visualization, all in one clean file!

Here is a link to my[Cleaned IGDB Games Dataset](https://github.com/LucasW-BYU/Post-2-Video-Rating/blob/main/igdb_games_clean_data_sorted.csv)This setup keeps everything organized and easy to explore, giving me a solid starting point for digging into game trends and patterns.

#  **5.EDA**
With the dataset cleaned and prepared, the next step was to dive into some exploratory data analysis (EDA) to get a sense of trends and relationships within the data. By visualizing ratings across different game genres, platforms, and over time, we can start identifying patterns that may influence a game's success. Here are three key insights derived from the EDA:

## Distribution of Game Genres 
![Distribution of Game Genres]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/download%20(6)%20(1).png)
As a first step in exploring the dataset, I created a word cloud to visualize the distribution of game genres. In the cloud, larger genres represent more frequent occurrences, giving us a quick snapshot of the datasetâ€™s focus. Role-playing (RPG), Adventure, and Strategy emerge as the most prominent genres, hinting at their popularity or high representation in the dataset. In contrast, smaller genres like Quiz/Trivia and Arcade suggest more niche interest or fewer entries. This genre distribution provides an initial sense of the datasetâ€™s composition and sets up the analysis for identifying trends and factors that might influence game ratings.

## Average Rating by Genre
Let's dive into the genres! When we look at the average ratings across different types of games, some interesting patterns emerge. Tactical, Real-Time Strategy (RTS), and Music games are right at the top, boasting the highest average ratings. This could mean that players really appreciate the strategic complexity or immersive qualities these genres bring to the table. Maybe it's the thrill of outsmarting an opponent in a strategy game or getting lost in a beautifully composed soundtrack that earns these games their high praise.

On the other hand, genres like Quiz/Trivia arenâ€™t faring quite as well in the ratings department. It might be that these games have a more limited audience or offer less replay value, which could affect their overall scores. Itâ€™s definitely worth exploring what makes certain genres consistently more popularâ€”could it be the gameplay depth, the emotional impact, or something else entirely?


## Average Rating by Platform (Top 10)

In this chart, I looked at the top 10 platforms with the highest average game ratings (blue bars) alongside the number of games on each platform (orange line).

High-Rated Platforms: Platforms like Sega Saturn and DOS show high average ratings, suggesting that classic titles on these platforms are well-regarded by players.
Game Quantity vs. Quality: Platforms like PlayStation and Nintendo 3DS have more games but slightly lower average ratings, which might be due to a wider variety in game quality.
Selective Platforms: Platforms with fewer games, like Atari ST/STE, still hold high ratings, indicating that although the library is smaller, it maintains a high standard.
This analysis helps me see the balance between the number of games and their average quality across different platforms.

# **6.Conclusion**
The EDA provides meaningful insights into the factors that may contribute to a gameâ€™s success in terms of player ratings. Genres like Tactical, RTS, and Music stand out with higher average ratings, suggesting that players value games with strategic depth and immersive elements. In contrast, genres with lower ratings, such as Quiz/Trivia, might appeal to a more niche audience, which may impact their replay value and overall ratings.

For platforms, classic systems like Sega Saturn and DOS achieve high average ratings, indicating that games on these platforms resonate well with players, possibly due to nostalgia or quality-focused game libraries. In contrast, popular platforms like PlayStation and Nintendo 3DS offer a wider variety of games, which may lead to slightly lower average ratings due to mixed game quality. Platforms with smaller but more selective libraries, such as Atari ST/STE, maintain high ratings, emphasizing a focus on quality over quantity.
These findings illustrate that a game's rating is influenced by both its genre and platform, with player preferences leaning toward strategically engaging genres and well-curated platform libraries.

All set to venture farther? To investigate your preferred genres and platforms, try these steps using your own data or use the IGDB API.
